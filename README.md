## Hi, I'm Jonathan Martin 👋
Machine Learning Engineer willing to relocate, with 4+ years of experience in developing Machine learning solutions (mainly using Python, R, with Tensorflow and Pythorch). Currently been a Ph.D. Candidate waiting to defend the thesis and teacher assistant at Faculty of Informatics, National University of La Plata, Argentina, where I research as a member of the Research and Development in Advanced IT Lab (LIFIA). Professional with development, research, and teaching skills, focused on Machine Learning, Web Engineering, and Object-Oriented Programming. My research interests are Support Decision-making and Deep Learning. Aiming to contribute to building world-class Machine learning solutions and to continue learning and improving my skills, especially those related to Deep Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning.
